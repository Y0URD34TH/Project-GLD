### Guidelines / Tips for adding translations

-   Quality > quantity. If you are unsure about a translation, leave it blank. It is better to have a blank translation than a wrong one.
-   It's always better to translate strings on a way that sounds more natural / makes more sense to a native speaker, even if you'd use completely different words or phrases to accomplish it. Translations don't have to be 100% literal.
-   Do not change / translate any strings that have **%** or **##** in front of them, e.g. "**%f**", **"##popup"**.
-   If your translation is a lot longer than the initial string, please use \n to add a new line to ensure the entire translation will be visible.

## How to Translate

There are two ways of doing it:<br>

-   ### Using Github
<details>

1. **[Fork the repo](https://github.com/Y0URD34TH/Project-GLD/fork)**
2. Navigate to the **[Translations folder](https://github.com/Y0URD34TH/Project-GLD/tree/main/Translations)** in your fork
3. Add a new **.json** file for the language you'd like to help translate (e.g. French.json, German.json, Japanese.json)
4. Copy the entire **[English.json](https://github.com/Y0URD34TH/Project-GLD/blob/main/Translations/English.json)** file content and paste it in your language file
5. Leave the strings on the left, replace the strings on the right with your translations (e.g. "String":"YourTranslation")
6. When you're done, save the changes to your fork and make a pull request!
