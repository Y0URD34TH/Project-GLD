        "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is an open-world, action-adventure game, developed by Sucker Punch and produced by Sony, exclusively for the Playstation 4. The game was released on July 17, 2020.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Set on Tsushima Island, in the year 1274, at the time of the First Mongol Invasion of Japan. The Mongols, led by General Khotun Khan, have invaded Tsushima and slaughtered most of the samurai there with unconventional military tactics. Jin Sakai, a samurai and one of the few survivors of the initial attack, is saved from the brink of death by a thief, and tries to get revenge on Khotun to save his uncle, Lord Shimura, but Khotun easily knocks him off a bridge. Jin then reluctantly learns how to fight like a dishonorable Ghost, combined with his own Samurai techniques, to rescue his uncle and eventually expel the Mongols from Tsushima.</p><h3>Iki Island</h3><p>Introduced in the Director's Cut (or DLC upgrade). Jin is alerted to the presence of a Mongol shaman named Ankshar Khatun, nicknamed The Eagle, who has taken over Iki and sits in Fort Sakai, where Jin's father ruled and later died when Jin was young. Jin decides to travel to Iki to investigate the island and how The Eagle drove some of her prisoners into madness before she gains enough power to invade Tsushima.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players can tackle most missions in one of two ways: as the honorable Samurai, Jin can challenge enemy leaders to duels, and use multiple forms of sword and bow combat to bring death to multiple enemies. As the dishonorable Ghost, Jin can make use of different items to distract enemies, quietly assassinate them, or even make lesser Mongols tremble in fear of his reputation.</p><p>During combat, players can use up to four different sword stances that are each proficient at staggering specific enemy types. Player health is regenerated by using Resolve. Resolve is gained by eliminating enemies and through certain Charms the player can equip.</p><p>Outside of combat, players can be guided by the wind (known as the \"Guiding Wind\") to their objective by swiping up on the PS4 controller touchpad. By following NPCs and other creatures can find hidden shrines, charms, or other items. By collecting enough supplies and items, Jin can improve his armor, blades, bow, Ghost weapons, or even acquire new colors for his equipped armor.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>For most of the game, Jin will carry two main weapons: his katana for most attacks, and his tanto for stealth assassinations. Jin will gain access to additional equipment through the game, either through story missions or side quests.</p><h3>Ghost Weapons (Quickfire)</h3><ul><li><strong>Kunai</strong> - Sharp blades that can be thrown at enemies to stagger them, or even kill them if their health is low enough.</li><li><strong>Sticky Bomb</strong> - A pitch-covered bomb that sticks to the closest enemy when Jin throws it, heavily damaging them and all nearby enemies.</li><li><strong>Smoke Bomb</strong> - A quick-acting explosive that blinds all enemies nearby when Jin drops it at his feet. Can be used to escape a battle or to assassinate enemies in the middle of a fight.</li><li><strong>Way of the Flame</strong> - A mythic ability Jin learns after completing The Undying Flame sidequest. Jin uses incendiary oil to temporarily set his katana on fire, making his attacks unblockable and setting hit enemies on fire for several seconds.</li></ul><h3>Ghost Weapons (Throwable)</h3><ul><li><strong>Wind Chime</strong> - A simple wind chime that will attract a single enemy who hears it nearby.</li><li><strong>Firecracker</strong> - An upgraded version of the Wind Chime that can be acquired by spending Technique Points on it, will attract multiple enemies in a bigger radius to its location.</li><li><strong>Black Powder Bomb</strong> - A simple throwable bomb that explodes on impact, staggers and damages all enemies caught in its blast radius.</li></ul><h3>Half-Bow</h3><p>Acquired during The Tale of Sensei Ishikawa, Jin's main bow weapon.</p><ul><li>Normal Arrows - simple arrows that can hit targets from afar, but can be blocked by armor or shields</li><li>Flaming Arrows - can set enemies on fire, as well as multiple enemies if fired at dry grass.</li></ul><h3>Longbow</h3><p>Acquired by completing The Curse of Uchitsune mythic tale. Cannot be fired from a stealthy position, but has more range and powerful arrows than the Half-Bow.</p><ul><li>Heavy Arrow - Unlike normal arrows, will penetrate armor and can be used to headshot enemies with helmets.</li><li>Explosive Arrow - Essentially a Black Powder Bomb strapped to a Heavy Arrow, the shot will stagger and heavily damage most enemies hit with it, as well as any enemy in a nearby radius.</li></ul><h3>Blowgun</h3><p>Obtained during the Ghosts from the Past tale. A short-ranged sniping weapon but fires completely silent.</p><ul><li>Poison Dart - Instantly kills most enemies hit by it, with a good chance of terrifying weaker enemies nearby and causing them to flee.</li><li>Hallucination Dart - Acquired during The Proud Do Not Endure sidequest. Most enemies hit by this dart will temporarily gain increased health and attack power, but turn berserk and start attacking their allies, who will attempt to fight back and strike them down. Berserk enemies will also attack Jin if they spot him.</li></ul><h2>Legends Mode (Co-Op)</h2><p>On October 16, 2020, Sucker Punch released a free update to the game that added a new cooperative mode called Ghost of Tsushima: Legends. The cooperative mode takes a more mythological approach to the lore and includes story missions plus a wave-based survival mode. Players earn new cosmetic items as well as gear that adds to a persistent gear score per class.</p><p>The Legends are available either as a two-player story mission, or a four-player horde mode where the players must work together to fight off waves of Mongols and Oni warriors attempting to conquer three control points.</p><p>There are four classes to play as:</p><ul><li>Samurai: Skilled in melee combat, with a technique that can siphon health from nearby enemies, and a Resolve technique that can instantly cut down three weaker enemies nearby.</li><li>Hunter: A master archer who can strike down enemies from afar, including a technique that is guaranteed to hit up to three enemies in range.</li><li>Ronin: A support class who can summon spirit animals to fight with him, and has a special technique that can revive downed allies anywhere on the battlefield.</li><li>Assassin: The master of stealth who can throw down a poisonous smoke bomb that damages and blinds enemies caught inside it, and has a special technique that can assassinate up to three unaware enemies nearby.</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Preset</th><th scope=\"col\">Minimum (720p @ 30fps)</th><th scope=\"col\">Recommended (1080p @ 60fps)</th><th scope=\"col\">High (1440p @ 60fps, or 4K @ 30fps)</th><th scope=\"col\">Ultra (4K @ 60fps)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 10, or later</td><td><p>Windows 10, or later</p></td><td><p>Windows 10, or later</p></td><td><p>Windows 10, or later</p></td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td> Intel Core i3 7100, or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</td><td>  <p>Intel Core i5 8600, or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</p></td><td>  <p>Intel Core i5 11400, or AMD Ryzen 5 5600</p></td><td>  <p>Intel Core i5 11400, orAMD Ryzen 5 5600</p></td></tr><tr><td>  <p>Graphics</p></td><td>  <p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB, or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></td><td>  <p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060, or AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT</p></td><td>  <p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, or AMD Radeon RX 6800</p></td><td>  <p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</p></td></tr><tr><td>  <p>Memory</p></td><td>  <p>8GB</p></td><td> 16GB</td><td> 16GB</td><td> 16GB</td></tr><tr><td>  <p>Storage</p></td><td>  <p>75GB HDD space (SSD recommended)</p></td><td><p>75GB SSD space</p>  </td><td>  <p>75GB SSD space</p></td><td>  <p>75GB SSD space</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

There are a total of 70 Perks, each with its own mini ranking system, totaling 275 ranks.</p><p>Perks are no longer tied to the player’s character level or relative Skill level. The 70 Perks are divided into groups of 10 under each of the 7 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. Each Perk requires a different value of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat that it is tied to, from 1 to 10. For each point in a stat, the same number of perks in that stat’s group is available to the player.</p><p>Each time the character levels up, the player can add an additional Perk, upgrade an already acquired Perk, or forgo Perks and instead add a level to one of their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats.</p><h3>Apparel and Weapons</h3><p>Fallout 4 allows for greater weapon and armor customization than previous games, and there is no longer a degradation system except for power armor.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong></p><p>The player can create weapon modifications to customize their original weapons. These mods can be attached to the base weapons while at weapon workbenches found throughout the world. There are over 50 base weapons with more than 700 total different modifications.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2769953\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.png\" data-ratio=\"0.55703125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2769953\"><img alt=\"Custom weapon with mods\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2769953-weaponmodsex.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Custom weapon with mods</figcaption></figure><p>The different mods include barrels, grips, scopes, and more. Each weapon mod will affect certain stats of the existing base weapon, including damage and fire rate.</p><p>Each weapon mod is built from scratch and requires its own set of base raw materials. The player can collect everyday objects in the environment -- such as radios, lamps, glue bottles, and wrenches -- and scrap them into the raw materials needed to build the weapon mods.</p><p>To customize gun weapons, the player will need the Gun Nut perk. For energy weapons, the Science! perk will be required. Occasionally a combination of the two will be required for more advanced modifications.</p><p><strong>Apparel</strong></p><p>Fallout 4 allows the player to equip individual pieces of armor for their arms, legs, and chest. These pieces stack over an underlying layer of armor; however, armor pieces cannot be worn over apparel that is designated as clothing. Similar to weapons, armor pieces can be upgraded and modded at armor workbench to strengthen damage resistance and add new effects like increased carry weight, faster move speed, and more.</p><p>Power armor is reworked for Fallout 4. Unlike previous games, power armor is no longer equipped like normal armor. Instead, power armor suits are effectively piloted and have their own movement speed. Power armor runs on Fusion Cores which can be found in the world. Each suit of power armor consists of a frame and individual arm, leg, chest, and helmet pieces. These pieces can be swapped, modified, and upgraded similar to normal pieces of armor. This requires a special power armor crafting station. Power armor has the most advanced modifications, allowing for enhancements such as food radiation scrubbing, jetpacks, targeting interfaces, and more.</p><p><strong>Legendary Equipment</strong></p><p>Players can encounter Legendary versions of enemies that have significantly more health than their standard counterparts. These Legendary variants spawn randomly at a rate of occurrence dependent on the player's difficulty level. Legendary enemies carry a unique weapon or armor piece that has a random modifier attached to it.

On February 16th, 2016 Bethesda announced an expansion to their DLC plans and released information on the first three add-ons: <em>Automatron</em>, <em>Wasteland Workshop</em>, and <em>Far Harbor</em>. Also announced was a price increase of the season pass starting March 1st, from $29.99 to $49.99 USD. All players who bought the Season pass before March 1st for the $29.99 USD price will still have access to all DLC.</p><h3>Automatron</h3><p><strong>Release: March 22, 2016</strong></p><p><strong>Price: $9.99 USD</strong></p><p>A mysterious man named the \"Mechanist\" arrives in the Commonwealth, and unleashed his army of robots on the wastelands, lead by their leader \"Robobrain\". To defeat the Mechanist, the player can build and modify their own robot companions, mixing hundred of limbs, armor, abilities, and weapons - including a new lightning chain gun. The robots can also have customizable paint colors and voices.</p><h3>Wasteland Workshop</h3><p><strong>Release: April 12, 2016</strong></p><p><strong>Price: $4.99 USD</strong></p><p><em>Wasteland Workshop</em> builds on the Settlement building gameplay. The player can now design and place cages to capture live monsters in the wastelands, including humans. The captured animals can then either be tamed or trained to fight other captured animals, or even the human citizens of the settlement. The DLC also adds new design options for the settlements, including nixie tube lighting, letter kits, and taxidermy.</p><h3>Far Harbor</h3><p><strong>Release: May 2016</strong></p><p><strong>Price: $24.99 USD</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2827451\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2827451\"><img alt=\"Far Harbor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.png 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Far Harbor\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.png 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/46/2827451-0149222852-Fallo.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Far Harbor</figcaption></figure><p>A new case arrives at the Valentine's Detective Agency, leading the <a href=\"/sole-survivor/3005-32060/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32060\">Sole Survivor</a> and <a href=\"/nick-valentine/3005-32451/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32451\">Nick Valentine</a> off the coast of Maine to a mysterious island called <em>Far Harbor</em>, to search for a lost young woman and a secret colony of synths.

The DLC's main category involved conveyor belts and manufacturing machines that could produce items from the base game such as clothing, weapons, ammo, and general items. Other additions included often requested pieces like gun racks and mannequins for displaying armor, elevators, and a new category of buildings dubbed \"warehouses\" that followed a similar layout to the \"barns\" category added in <em>Far Habor</em>.</p><h3>Vault-Tec Workshop</h3><p><strong>Release: July 2016</strong></p><p><strong>Price: $4.99 USD</strong></p><p><em>Vault-Tec Workshop</em> follows <em>Contraptions</em> and <em>Wasteland Workshop</em> in being primarily a settlement based add-on, but also includes a basic quest line to tie the DLC's location into the story of the world. The player receives a radio transmission from Vault 88's security system, drawing them to Quincy Quarry where they deal with the raiders trying to break into the vault. Once inside, the player meets Overseer Barstow, who is now a ghoul. She tasks the player character with clearing out the building area of Vault 88 before sending them on a series of quests that involve gathering materials needed for the vault's original planned experimentation while also granting the ability to construct the vault from scratch through the new \"vault\" structure category in the settlement building menu. After the vault is built and established, a few settlers arrive, including one enthusiastic man named Clem, and the player then proceeds to subject him and the others to several Vault-Tec approved experiments that range from producing power to reading minds. How these experiments are conducted is up to the player and can range from the typical nefarious nature of true Vault-Tec experiments or be geared to actually be helpful (much to Overseer Barstow's chagrin). The DLC also gives the player the ability to build vaults at any settlement they own, expanding the creative options all across the Commonwealth.</p><h3>Nuka-World</h3><p><strong>Release: August 2016</strong></p><p><strong>Price: $19.99 USD</strong></p><p><i>Nuka-World</i> is Fallout 4's second story and landmass based expansion, similar to <em>Far Harbor</em>. The player learns through a radio broadcast of a location known as <a href=\"/nuka-world/3035-5510/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-5510\">Nuka-World</a>, an amusement park built around the theme of the <em>Fallout</em> universe's quintessential beverage, Nuka-Cola. Upon arrival, the player discovers Nuka-World is overrun by raiders, and is sent through \"The Gauntlet\", a series of traps and enemies meant to kill those who enter for the entertainment of the park's denizens. At the end of the Gauntlet, the player faces the raider gangs' current \"Overboss\" in a Mad Max-esque thunderdome, and upon victory, is dubbed the new Overboss by <a href=\"/porter-gage/3005-40608/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-40608\">Porter Gage</a> (a recruitable companion). The player is now responsible for clearing out the other areas of the park (Galactic Zone, Kiddie Kingdom, Dry Rock Gulch, Safari Adventure, and <a href=\"/world-of-refreshment/3035-5521/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-5521\">World of Refreshment</a>) and giving each area to one of the three raider gangs of Nuka-World: <a href=\"/the-pack/3015-9517/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9517\">The Pack</a>, <a href=\"/disciples/3015-9519/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9519\">The Disciples</a>, and <a href=\"/operators/3015-9518/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9518\">The Operators</a>. Alternatively, the player is able to \"deal with\" each of the raider gang bosses and therefore release Nuka-World from their tyranny. Outside of the new area, players are also able to take over settlements in the Commonwealth and give control of them to one of the raider factions, allowing the player to essentially become a raider gang, similar to the many others found throughout the Commonwealth (an often requested feature from the community).</p><h2>Versions</h2><h3>Pip-Boy Edition</h3><figure data-align=\"right\"

Softworks</a> tweeted a teaser #PleaseStandBy on June 2, 2015, and updated their Fallout website to feature only a countdown clock, expiring on June 3, 2015 at 10:00 AM EDT.</p><p>A few seconds before 10:00 AM on June 3rd, Bethesda released a teaser trailer for Fallout 4 on their website and YouTube. The trailer showed a desolated Boston, Massachusetts with various landmarks, Vault 111, and a male character wearing a jumpsuit from the aforementioned Vault.</p><h3>E3 2015</h3><p>At their first ever E3 press conference, <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda</a> revealed the opening story and gameplay footage, featuring an updated V.A.T.S., locations, and armor and weapon customization. Also revealed is a brand new feature to the <a href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-183\">Fallout</a> series: crafting and building settlements. The player can gather in game materials to \"scrap\", allowing them to construct individual buildings and entire settlements, equipped with electricity and defense systems.

After the war, Niko couldn’t find any work in what was now a war-torn country, and began a life of crime, eventually landing him in the pocket of <a href=\"../../rodislav-bulgarin/94-1664/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rodislav Bulgarin</a>; a Russian mobster in charge of the Mediterranean immigrant smuggling business.</p><p>After working some time for Bulgarin, a ship that Niko was aboard sank a few miles off the Italian coastline. Barely surviving the swim, Bulgarin believed that Niko intentionally sunk it in order to escape with the money. Niko realized this to be what Bulgarin thought, and had no choice but to avert the Russian Mafia. He spent seven months upon the merchant navy ship, The Platypus, contemplating joining his cousin, Roman, in his lavish and luxurious American life.</p><p>When The Platypus pulls into the City, Niko disembarks and is soon after picked up by his cousin to drive back to Roman’s place. When they get back, however, Niko is quick to observe that all Roman had told him was a great exaggeration, and in reality Roman had nothing but a poor apartment and small cab company. Roman’s gambling addiction landed him in debt to loan shark <a href=\"../../vlad-glebov/94-1015/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Vlad</a>. Roman has a girlfriend called Mallorie, who introduces Niko to <a href=\"../../michelle/94-4751/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Michelle</a> and who Roman suspects to be sleeping with Vlad. When Niko finds out that Roman had been correct, he contemplates for a moment with Roman, and then decides to exact revenge, to Roman’s great surprise. Niko and Roman get into a car and chase Vlad to the Pier. Vlad tries to justify his existence, and tells Niko that if he shoots, people will find him. Niko kills Vlad and dumps his body into the water. A few hours later, Roman calls him, and, in a hushed tone, tells him where to rendezvous. Niko finds Roman hiding in a dumpster, where Roman speaks of gangsters chasing him. Niko is in disbelief before he’s knocked out with the butt of a rifle.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838167\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-838167\"><img alt=\"Niko brandishing a shotgun\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Niko brandishing a shotgun\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Niko brandishing a shotgun</figcaption></figure><p>Waking up in the basement of <a href=\"../../mikhail-faustin/94-1023/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mikhail Faustin</a>'s house, Niko is questioned by the captor as well as Faustin’s partner in crime, <a href=\"../../dimitri-rascalov/94-941/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dimitri Rascalov</a>, until Faustin himself comes down to tell them to keep their voices low, when he discovers his goon to be incorrectly interrogating Niko, and consequently shoots him. Roman begins to lose his cool and Faustin decides to shoot him too, but only in the stomach. Dimitri calms down Faustin, who tells Niko to complete a task; with Dimitri promising to heal Roman’s wound. Niko works under Faustin and Dimitri for a while, as they gradually drift apart, and Dimitri finally asks Niko to kill Faustin. Niko chases Faustin through his club until a final confrontation on the roof. Faustin claims that has made Dimitri greedy and that he will betray Niko as well. Niko pays no heed and kills him. Afterwards Dimitri requests Niko meet him at a warehouse to receive his payment.</p><p><a href=\"../../little-jacob/94-189/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Little Jacob</a>, a drug dealer Niko had worked with earlier in the game, calls immediately after Niko’s conversation with Dimitri, telling him he has a bad feeling about the whole shindig and will be at his side during the meet. Once Niko makes his way into the warehouse, he finds Dimitri’s new partner to be Rodislav Bulgarin. Niko realizes that the meet was a trap, and duels with Dimitri’s henchmen in the warehouse with the assistance of Little Jacob. Niko frees Roman from the back of a car some time later and drives them both to Roman’s cab company, only to find it burning violently, along with his apartment. Roman is devastated, and after crying to Niko (the “mission” is called Roman’s Sorrow) he rings up Mallorie and asks her to find them a place in Bohan. Roman then concludes the mission by revealing to Niko that the “special item” he had referred to when Niko rescued him was an engagement ring. It had burned, lying in his apartment.</p><p>The two of them take shelter in Bohan, where Niko finds he can be of some service to the locals, at first only <a href=\"../../manny-escuela/94-1022/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Manny Escuela</a> and <a href=\"../../elizabeta-torres/94-696/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Elizabeta Torres</a>, Elizabeta introduces Niko to <a href=\"../../playboy-x/94-137/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Playboy X</a> and <a href=\"../../packie-mcreary/94-439/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Patrick McReary</a>. Working under Playboy X, Niko discovers that Playboy’s mentor, <a href=\"../../dwayne-forge/94-703/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dwayne Forge</a>, has been recently released from prison. Playboy asks Niko to meet with Dwayne, who Niko greatly sympathizes with. Niko starts accepting missions from Dwayne as well, without pay, until Dwayne asks him to kill the managers at a strip club. Niko does as instructed, but soon after finds out that Playboy owned that strip club. Playboy, furious, asks Niko to take out Dwayne. Niko contemplates, and, depending on the player’s decision, kills one of them. Meanwhile, Roman rebuilds the cab company, with the assistance of his insurance company, who think that the original company burned down because of an electrical fire. He rediscovers his passion for gambling, which lands him, once again, in the pocket of Russian loan sharks. In <a href=\"../../algonquin/95-2010/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Algonquin</a>, Niko befriends Patrick McReary, who he’d worked with earlier, upon Elizabeta’s command. Patrick and Niko become friends and soon Niko gets to know the McReary family and circle of trust, which includes <a href=\"../../derrick-mcreary/94-4173/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Derrick McReary</a>, <a href=\"../../francis-mcreary/94-1035/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Francis McReary</a>, <a href=\"../../gerry-mcreary/94-4236/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gerry McReary</a> and last but not least, <a href=\"../../kate-mcreary/94-438/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kate McReary</a>. After the introductions and a few missions, Niko gets a call from a terrified Elizabeta. He goes to her house, where she tells him that the cops are onto her. She inadvertently kills Manny Escuela, and then sends to Niko to do a drug deal with Little Jacob, only to find out that the person who intercepts Niko’s deal is none other than Michelle, his girl friend. Niko doesn’t mince words with her, but soon after surrenders and discovers that she works for a secret government organization called United Liberty Paper. Her role in the game is concluded when she hands Niko over to the unnamed man leading U. L. Paper, who bribes Niko with the information he has on his criminal activities. Niko agrees to do dirty work for the government, as long as they help him find a “special someone”.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-907163\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71777777777778\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-907163\"><img alt=\"Jimmy Pegorino\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg 450w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jimmy Pegorino\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg 450w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jimmy Pegorino</figcaption></figure><p>Patrick McReary’s family leads him to the Italian mobsters <a href=\"../../ray-boccino/94-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ray Boccino</a> and <a href=\"../../phil-bell/94-1037/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Phil Bell</a>, who soon after introduce him to <a href=\"../../jimmy-pegorino/94-1030/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jimmy Pegorino</a>. Working under their wing and helping the McReary’s, Niko finally gets a lead from Ray: Ray tells him the whereabouts of Florian Cravic. Niko, with Roman, busts through Florian’s apartment, gun in hand, only to find a much calmer man, now named Bernie, who moved to safely pursue his homosexuality. He dispels Niko’s idea that Florian, or Bernie, was the one who sold out their unit, and tells him that all this time he had thought Niko to be the one. Frustrated and disappointed, Niko leaves with no resolve. He ceases working for Ray and finds closure with the all but one of the McReary’s, Kate, with whom he has an ongoing relationship. U. L. Paper had Niko working with Jon Gravelli, an old mobster about to hit the bucket, who eventually gives Niko the one person he is sure sold out their platoon: Darko Brevich. Niko informs Roman that he’s found Darko, and Roman decides to meet the old friend as well, Niko and Roman head off to the Airport, As they enter the Airport a truckfull of government soldiers circle around the backlot and drops off a miserable looking man who is bound by ropes. Niko confronts him, and when Darko asks who Niko is, he replies only with, “I’m the one who survived.” Darko then proceeds to justify his actions, telling Niko that their unit had killed some of his friends, some of his family. Still furious, Niko asks him how much they payed him. Darko laughs and replies, “A thousand. How much do they pay you to kill someone?” Niko is suddenly thrown into contemplation when Darko contrasts the two of them, but then Darko pleas for him to end his life, telling Niko that he’d be doing him a favor. The player gets to decide whether or not Niko kills Darko. If he does, right before Darko bleeds out, he thanks Niko for ending his life. Niko eventually regrets this decision. If Niko decides to let Darko live, both Bernie and Roman congratulate him for finally burying his past.</p><p>Niko, still suffering from the shock of his confrontation with Brevich, tries to cool off at a bar. There, he finds Jimmy P, whose empire is falling apart and needs Niko to do him one last solid: Work with Dimitri Rascalov. Niko is at first morally resistant to the idea, but Pegorino persists, and the player is given the ultimate ethical decision: either you sell your soul to the devil, or you become him. The outcome is detailed in the next section.</p><h2>Multiple Endings</h2><p>After Niko’s conversation with Pegorino, you have to drive around for a while before Niko is called by Kate McReary and Roman. Niko isn’t very specific with Kate, he only tells her that a decision came up, and that he can either earn money or make good on something he promised to do. Kate, given this extremely abstract version of the actual situation, adheres to her moral code and tells Niko to do so, as well. Roman, however, believes that Niko should go through with the deal, not only because Roman prefers money to violence, but because he’d like the money for his honeymoon with soon-to-be bride Mallorie, as well as help him earn the money he needs to live the life he always wanted to with his cousin.</p><h3>Seeking Revenge</h3><p>If you choose to extract revenge, you will find Dimitri on The Platypus, the very same ship you were on when you arrived in Liberty City. After fighting through Dimitri’s men, you must pull a lever and get to the bottom of the ship, where you confront Dimitri alongside his henchmen. Shortly after Niko kills Dimitri, he attends Roman’s wedding, where he is ambushed by Pegorino and his goons as they drive by. Everyone successfully evades the attempted murder except for Kate, who is shot dead. Niko is deeply disturbed by her death, when Roman and Jacob tell him to get going and take a nap.</p><p>When Niko wakes up, he gets a call from Little Jacob, who, alongside Roman, has decided to take down Pegorino and whatever’s left of his empire. All three of them chase a car full of his goons to Pegorino’s hideout. Niko slides out of the car and tells Roman and Jacob that the most useful thing they can do is ensure that they don’t die, and maybe figure out an exit strategy. There is a great struggle and Niko finally makes it inside and to the top of the building, where he encounters Pegorino, who slides down a ladder and escapes via boat. Niko chases him down and gets into Jacob’s chopper and continues his pursuit. Both Pegorino and Niko crash, wherein Niko chases Pegorino alone and eventually kills him, but not before delivering a <b>grand</b> monologue.</p><h3>Taking the Deal</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971503\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6605504587156\" data-width=\"436\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 436px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971503\"><img alt=\"Living the dream.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg 436w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Living the dream.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg 436w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Living the dream.</figcaption></figure><p>If you choose to make the deal, you are sent in alongside Phil Bell to rendezvous with Dimitri's men. Dimitri betrays Niko, who has to fight his way out of the compound with Phil and $250,000. When Niko heads back, he tells Kate that he decided to do the job for the money, for which she is furious at him and refuses to go to his cousin’s wedding. He goes without her, and after the usual proceedings, one of Dimitri’s men opens fire on the crowd. Roman is shot down and killed, for which Niko is very angry. He hits the goon’s dead body a few times before going home at the will of Jacob. When he wakes up, he decides to kill Dimitri. You again follow Pegorino’s goons to the building where Pegorino and Dimitri set up shop. Niko tells Jacob that he’ll handle it alone, and after a great conflict, he finally makes it inside, where he sees Dimitri betray Pegorino and then attempt to escape, this time via helicopter. The rest is essentially the same, in that you follow Dimitri via helicopter until both of your vehicles crash. You track down Dimitri and kill him, the game ending with a shot of the Statue of Happiness.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>The GTA series had always had a variety of weapons to use.

Rather than offer a traditional multiplayer menu, the multiplayer is accessed from the cell phone that the player uses in single-player.</p><p>Players may create a multiplayer character using different accessories and clothing. As the player's rank increases, additional clothing and parts are unlocked. Once in the multiplayer mode, there are 14 game types to choose from. The maximum number of players is 16, though the <a href=\"../../cooperative-play/92-108/\" rel=\"nofollow \">co-operative</a> modes are limited to a lower number.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Mode</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Deathmatch</td><td>The traditional free-for-all mode, allowing up to sixteen players fight against each other on the streets of Liberty City, starting with the standard Glock pistols and being able to pick up more powerful weaponry littering the streets.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Team Deathmatch</b></td><td>Team Deathmatch is exactly the same concept as regular deathmatch, with sixteen players and up to eight teams supported. Work with your team to earn the most kills and dominate your opposition, by collecting more powerful weaponry littering the streets of the city.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Race</b></td><td>A traditional checkpoint race. Players are able to select between a variety of different courses around the city to race, as well as a number of laps and vehicles, as well as vehicle classes and weather conditions experienced. Prove your dominance behind the wheel.</td></tr><tr><td><b>GTA Race</b></td><td>GTA Race is a standard race, customized. Instead of starting off in a car, players must find a vehicle to drive, and are able to shoot one another to increase their chances of winning. Playing dirty has never been so justified.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mafiya Work</b></td><td>You're working for mobster Kenny Petrovic. When Kenny asks you to do something, you do it. Complete the contracts he demands of you to win, and try to beat Petrovic's other contractors in doing so, in order to earn the most money and win.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Team Mafiya Work</b></td><td>Complete Petrovic's assignments alongside your team and prevent the other team from completing them before you in order to earn Kenny's favor. Take out your opponents and do whatever it takes in order to emerge from the fight victorious.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Car Jack City</b></td><td>Cars will spawn around the city. Steal them and take them to the drop-off point before someone can do the same, or kill you and help themselves to the car you're attempting to deliver. And we wouldn't want that, would we?</td></tr><tr><td><b>Team Car Jack City</b></td><td>Work with your team to grab the cars and deliver them to the point. Your team comes against the other team - and you're trying to win, so you need to do whatever it takes. Earn the most money and your team wins.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cops n' Crooks</b></td><td>It's cops and robbers, just like during your childhood. Except you never murdered the cops. And the robbers weren't forced off the road in stolen sports cars. Crooks aim to get their boss to a safe point, while the cops try to ensure their boss winds up dead before he ever gets there.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Turf War</b></td><td>Turf War is effectively a conquest mode. Fight for the points and capture them within a given amount of time. The team holding the most points when time runs out are victorious.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hangman's N.O.O.S.E</b></td><td>The SWAT team are aware of Kenny Petrovic's arrival at Francis International Airport. It is up to you and your team to ensure that the 'boss' isn't arrested before he reaches his safehouse. And if that means killing a few police officers, so be it.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bomb da Base II</b></td><td>Bomb da Base II is an updated version of a <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\"><b>Grand Theft Auto III</b></a> mission sharing the name. A team of players must work together to destroy a point.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Free Mode</b></td><td>The online mode most heavily marketed for Grand Theft Auto IV, the mode acts as a lobby of sorts for players who are waiting to join another match or merely want to cause chaos across the entire city with friends. There is no goal in Free Mode, except to mess around and play with the options set by other players.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Radio Soundtracks</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>The Beat 102.7</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183367\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183367\"><img alt=\"Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap, R&amp;B\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap, R&amp;B\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183367-300px_beat_102.7.svg.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap, R&amp;B</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Swizz Beatz – \"Top Down\"</li><li>Nas – \"War is Necessary\"</li><li>Kanye West featuring: Dwele – \"Flashing Lights\"</li><li>Joell Ortiz featuring: Jadakiss &amp; Saigon – \"Hip Hop (Remix)\"</li><li>Fat Joe featuring: Lil Wayne – \"The Crackhouse\"</li><li>Mobb Deep – \"Dirty New Yorker\"</li><li>Ghostface Killah featuring: Kid Capri – \"We Celebrate\"</li><li>Styles P featuring: Sheek Louch &amp; Jadakiss – \"Blow Your Mind (Remix)\"</li><li>Papoose – \"Stylin'\"</li><li>Styles P – \"What's the Problem\"</li><li>Uncle Murda – \"Anybody Can Get It\"</li><li>Qadir – \"Nickname\"</li><li>Busta Rhymes – \"Where's My Money\"</li><li>Maino – \"Getaway Driver\"</li><li>Red Cafe – \"Stick'm\"</li><li>Tru-Life – \"Wet 'em Up\"</li><li>Johnny Polygon – \"Price on Your Head\"</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>The Classics 104.1</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183369\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.31666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:31.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183369\"><img alt=\"Golden age hip hop\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Golden age hip hop\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30036/1183369-300px_the_classics.svg.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Golden age hip hop</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Group Home – \"Supa Star\"</li><li>Brand Nubian – \"All for One\"</li><li>Special Ed – \"I Got It Made\"</li><li>Jeru the Damaja – \"D.

Microsoft was rumored to have paid 50 million dollars to keep the DLC exclusive to the Xbox 360 version of the game, although this sum was never confirmed. Despite Rockstar's promise, as 2008 dragged on, the DLC was delayed to an unspecified date in 2009. On November 19th, 2008, USA Today revealed the details on the first downloadable content package, The Lost and Damned. This episode was also released for PS3 on April 13th, 2010.</p><h2>The Lost and Damned</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066797\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1060606060606\" data-width=\"330\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 330px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066797\"><img alt=\"GTA: The Lost and Damned\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg 330w\"><noscript><img alt=\"GTA: The Lost and Damned\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\"></noscript></a><figcaption>GTA: The Lost and Damned</figcaption></figure><p>The first piece of downloadable package for <b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b> 4 is titled \"The Lost and Damned\" and was released on February 17th for the Xbox 360 exclusively; it cost 1,600 Microsoft Points and was 1.78gb in size.</p><p>The package contains new missions, side missions, music and weapons; giving players between 10 and 20 hours of new gameplay. Although Niko Bellic appears in the DLC he is not the playable character; the player instead assumes the role of a very minor character from the main storyline, a biker named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/johnny-klebitz/3005-8702/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8702\">Johnny Klebitz</a>. He's a member of the Liberty City biker gang \"<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lost-mc/3015-2840/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2840\">The Lost</a>\" (the same gang Niko meets in the main game). Dan Houser, Vice President of Creative Development for Rockstar Games, has stated that the episode shows a different side of Liberty City, and will answer many mysteries from the main story. Even though players encounter \"The Lost\" biker gang several times throughout the main game as Niko, the story for \"The Lost and Damned\" will not be directly impacted by decisions you made in the main game.</p><p>The story is mainly set in areas which were rarely visited whilst playing as Niko. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/billy-grey/3005-9594/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9594\">Billy Grey</a>, the Lost leader, has been released from jail and starts to wreak havoc on the ' <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/angels-of-death/3015-2845/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2845\">Angels of Death</a>', a rival gang, which breaks the truce between the two gangs. The player takes the role of Johnny Klebitz, the vice-president of the Lost, who temporarily took over role as Leader of the gang whilst Billy Grey was in jail. Johnny tries to stay calm as Billy breaks the truces set up by Johnny, but how long will he last knowing the gang could be falling apart?</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-837717\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-837717\"><img alt=\"Johnny Klebitz and Billy Grey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Johnny Klebitz and Billy Grey\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Johnny Klebitz and Billy Grey</figcaption></figure><p>The Lost and Damned has new weapons, such as the grenade launcher, pipe bomb, and sawn-off and automatic shotguns. The lighting has been reworked to appear more dramatic, and character models have been slightly improved. There are also new vehicles, such as Johnny's bike, which has been made easier to control than other motorbikes, as the player spends a lot of time riding it in the DLC. There is a safe house where Johnny can interact with his other brothers in the Lost, and try new minigames such as arm wrestling and card games, joining old favorites like pool. There are plenty of missions where Johnny rides out as part of a pack of the Lost in an organized formation with the leader in front, and his 'brothers' help him out in the tougher firefights. The player is encouraged to keep his brothers alive, and surviving members of the gang will receive a stats boost to their health, accuracy, and damage dealing after each mission. If a Lost member does die, he'll be replaced with a new brother with set-to-zero stats. Simply put, the longer they stay breathing, the more help they'll be. And the attempts to make the player feel like a member of a real biker gang don't stop there. When riding with the gang, a Lost logo will appear on the road to indicate where to ride in order to stay in formation. If the logo is properly followed, the player will be rewarded with dialogue with his brothers, as well as a small personal health boost and a vehicle health boost.</p><p>The Lost and Damned also includes new multiplayer modes. Some can simply be considered rehashes with motorbikes of older modes, while others are more noticeably different, like Chopper vs. Chopper, where one player runs through checkpoints in the city on a motorcycle while the other chases in a gun-toting helicopter. There is also a new revamped race mode where competing bikers are armed with clubs and take each other out in brutal fashion.</p><h2>New Weapons in The Lost and Damned</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Thrown Weapons</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Pipebomb</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1328148\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.34736842105263\" data-width=\"95\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 95px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:34.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1328148\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" data-width=\"95\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif 95w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" data-width=\"95\"></noscript></a></figure><br />The <a href=\"../../pipe-bomb/93-1806/\" rel=\"nofollow \">pipe bomb</a> is a crude homemade device that creates a large explosion.

The Ballad of Gay Tony tells the story of Luis Lopez.</p><p>Lopez had been the expected next protagonist, as he is the third major character in the GTA IV mission Impossible Trinity. Lopez is an assistant to the nightclub impresario Tony Prince (Gay Tony), who made a number of appearances in GTA <b>IV</b>. This installment of DLC focuses on the nightlife of <a href=\"/\">Liberty City</a> and makes use of many of the already present, but not interactive, night clubs and luxury spots throughout <a href=\"/\">Algonquin</a>. The episode contains new cars, new aircraft, and new weapons, including a new helicopter with mounted guns. It also brings back the parachute item, as seen in GTA San Andreas. Players can base jump from numerous tall buildings and locations around the open world map.</p><p>The Ballad of Gay Tony was released as a download and at retail as part of <a href=\"/\"><b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b>: Episodes from Liberty City</a>, which does not contain the original GTA <b>IV</b> content, but does have stand-alone, playable versions of The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. This disc retailed for 39.99 USD at launch. This content, as well as the disc, was released on October 29th, 2009. The disc version and downloadable version were both released for PS3 on April13th, 2010.</p><h2>New Weapons in The Ballad of Gay Tony</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Thrown Weapons</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Sticky Bombs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329816\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.051724137931\" data-width=\"58\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 58px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329816\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\" data-width=\"58\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png 58w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png 58w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\" data-width=\"58\"></noscript></a></figure><br /><a href=\"../../satchel-charge/93-1415/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Satchel Charges</a> can be used to tag vehicles or objects for remote detonation.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Pistols</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Pistol .44</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329815\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.51748251748252\" data-width=\"143\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 143px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329815\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" data-width=\"143\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png 143w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" data-width=\"143\"></noscript></a></figure><br />The AMT Automag Model 180 is a highly accurate handgun.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Submachine Guns</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Assault SMG</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.35585585585586\" data-width=\"222\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 222px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:35.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329814\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px\" data-width=\"222\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png 222w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png 222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px\" data-width=\"222\"></noscript></a></figure><br />The <a href=\"../../p90-smg/93-615/\" rel=\"nofollow \">P90</a> is a compact submachine gun; its lightweight design makes it ideal in urban environments.

It is the least accurate SMG in the game due to the lack of a stock and the fact it is fired from the hip, as opposed to the sights being brought to view by a character.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Shotguns</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Explosive Shotgun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329813\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.34955752212389\" data-width=\"226\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 226px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:35.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329813\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-width=\"226\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png 226w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14440/1329813-weapons_explosiveshotgun.png 226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-width=\"226\"></noscript></a></figure><br />The <a href=\"../../aa-12/93-2507/\" rel=\"nofollow \">AA-12</a> is an automatic shotgun capable of rapid fire action.

Due to the later release date and greater processing capabilities, the PC version is improved from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. The graphics are improved as the game will run in 2560 x 1600 resolution, with higher-quality textures and increased draw distances. Another enhancement is the ability to adjust the traffic density. The multiplayer allows 32 players, twice the 16 players allowed on the console version.</p><h3>GTA <b>IV</b> PC Video Editor</h3><p>The new Video Editor feature allows players to capture in-game footage, make real-time edits, and export those clips as .WMV movie files. The clips can also be spliced together into a video with post effects like music, text, transitions, and other features found in video editing programs. Videos can then be shared for other players to view and rate using the Rockstar Games Social Club TV.</p><p><b>Clip Capturing</b></p><p>At any time during the game (single or multiplayer), press the F2 key to dump the footage to the hard drive. Depending on how data intensive things are in the world at that time, the clip should be about 30 to 40 seconds long. Captured footage will be the action that occurs prior to pressing F2. This feature can be turned off to improve performance.</p><p><b>Launching the Video Editor</b></p><p>To execute the Video Editor, call it up using the in-game cellphone. After a prompt which states that any unsaved data will be lost, a menu for viewing and editing clips opens, with the following choices:</p><ul><li>Clips</li><li>Editor</li><li>Gallery</li><li>Upload</li><li>Online</li></ul><p>All footage captured in the game can be viewed in the Clips section. There are the standard DVD style controls for video playback. The camera can be moved when the right mouse button is held down.</p><p><b>Editor</b></p><p>The Editor allows users to name videos, string multiple clips together, and add music, titles, and transitions.</p><p>To quickly create a video to upload, make sure at least one clip is in the storyboard editing space and then hit the Web option in Export To Gallery.</p><p><b>Gallery</b></p><p>The section labeled Gallery contains all of the completed, exported videos. The most recently exported video is displayed in the preview window, and the thumbnails on the right side of the screen are arranged with the newest videos appearing at the top.</p><p><b>Upload</b></p><p>In the section labeled Upload, players can submit their web videos to the Social Club. The left side of the screen shows local videos that have created. The right side is a web portal displaying all the videos that have been uploaded.</p><p><b>Online</b></p><p>The Online section will minimize <b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>IV</b> and go to the Rockstar Games Social Club TV website using the default web browser. There users can view, rate, and comment on clips others have uploaded.</p><h2>Physics</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834766\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1834766\"><img alt=\"Roadkill\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roadkill\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roadkill</figcaption></figure><p>GTA IV is the second game to be released with the middleware named \"Euphoria\". Euphoria gives character models muscles, joints, a motor nervous system, and environmental awareness. This means that characters are capable of protecting themselves from injury by doing things such as grabbing on to a hand rail as they are falling down a staircase, or covering their face using their arms. GTA <b>IV</b> is the first game in the franchise to use physics middlewares, and is also the first Open World game to use Euphoria. There are many other features that Euphoria helps simulate, ranging from grabbing onto a car door to making Niko dynamically struggle to stand up straight when he is drunk.</p><p>Havok is another middleware used in GTA <b>IV</b>. It is only used for rigid bodies and vehicle dynamics. A rigid body is an object that cannot be deformed in any way. Remember that while props such as fences can be broken, it does not mean that they are not rigid bodies; instead of them splintering dynamically like real life, the engine is simply switching out the models. Havok has been implemented with quite a few AAA games, and is currently the world's leading physics middleware.</p><h2>Dating</h2><p>Expanding on <a href=\"../../grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/61-7120/\" rel=\"nofollow \">GTA: San Andreas</a>'s dating simulations, GTA IV allows Niko to take dates to bars, bowling alleys, cabaret acts, comedy clubs, darts bars, and pool clubs. He can also take characters from the main storyline that are friends to these destinations in order to obtain various bonuses. At these places, the player either watches a short performance or plays a minigame, except when going drinking.</p><p>Going drinking results in Niko and his companion emerging from their watering-hole extremely inebriated and unable to walk or drive straight. This resulted in some controversy over the inclusion of drunk-driving. The safe way to get back home though, as in real life, is to hail a taxi.</p><p>Comedians <a href=\"../../ricky-gervais/94-999/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ricky Gervais</a> and <a href=\"../../katt-williams/94-214/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Katt Williams</a> make appearances as themselves in comedy clubs.</p><h2>Internet</h2><p>GTA IV is the first in the series to feature a browsable, fictional Internet. Through computers at safe houses or <a href=\"../../tw-internet-cafe/95-306/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Tw@ Internet Cafes</a>, players can browse a substantial fictional Internet. It includes parodies of YouTube, MySpace, dating sites, and news sites. www.littlelacysurprisepageant.com is a site made to look like a trap for pedophiles.

At this time, outlaw gangs are disappearing and the <a href=\"/wild-west/3035-826/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-826\">wild west</a> era is about to end. Players take the role of Arthur Morgan, the right-hand man of the Van der Linde gang. The gang struggles to survive as the law threatens to destroy its way of life once and for all. Characters from the previous game, including <a href=\"/john-marston/3005-9449/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9449\">John Marston</a>, <a href=\"/bill-williamson/3005-15620/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15620\">Bill Williamson</a>, and <a href=\"/dutch-van-der-linde/3005-15727/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15727\">Dutch Van der Linde</a>, are also present.</p><p>Gameplay will follow the traditional Rockstar open world, with some new improvements and additions. The <a href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">morality </a> mechanic from the previous game is greatly expanded. The player has a vast number of options for interacting with NPCs, who will remember those actions in future encounters and act accordingly.</p><p>Rockstar has emphasized how the world will continue without the player's direct intervention. Characters have daily schedules they fulfill. They have independent conversations with each other. The player will get the sense that the world exists without them. With these advancements, Rockstar is trying to create a more believable world than ever before.</p><p>The traditional gameplay is supplemented by a new <a href=\"/base-building/3015-1307/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1307\">base building</a> system and a greater focus on multiplayer in the wake of <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-v/3030-36765/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36765\">GTA Online</a>. Little is known about the multiplayer aspects of Red Dead 2, but the game is rumored to follow the multiplayer setup of Free Roam akin to Red Dead Redemption.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>After a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang are forced to leave their substantial money stash and flee Blackwater. Realizing civilization's progress is ending the time of outlaws, they decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. They rob a train owned by Cornwall, who hires Pinkertons to apprehend them. The gang performs jobs to earn money, as Dutch continually promises the next heist will be their last. Following a shootout with the Pinkertons in Valentine, the gang relocate to Lemoyne, where they work simultaneously for the Grays and Braithwaites in an attempt to turn them against each other. However, the families double-cross them: the Grays kill a gang member during an ambush, while the Braithwaites kidnap and sell Jack to Bronte. The gang retaliate and destroy both families before retrieving Jack from Bronte, who offers them leads on work but eventually double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.</p><p>The gang robs a bank in Saint-Denis, but the Pinkertons intervene, killing Hosea and arresting John. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier, and Micah escape the city via a ship heading to Cuba. A torrential storm sinks the ship, and the men wash ashore on the island of Guarma, where they become embroiled in a war between tyrannical sugar plantation owner Fussar and the enslaved local population. After helping the revolutionaries kill Fussar, the group secured transport back to the United States and reunite with the rest of the gang.</p><p>Dutch obsesses over one last heist and doubts Arthur's loyalty after he disobeys him by liberating John earlier than planned, naming Micah, his top lieutenant, in Arthur's place. Arthur becomes concerned that Dutch is no longer the man he knew, as he is becoming insular, abandons their ideals, and murders Cornwall. He is faced with his mortality when he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Arthur reflects on his actions and how to protect the gang following his death, telling John to run away with Abigail and Jack and openly defying Dutch by aiding the local Native American people. When the Pinkertons assault the camp, Dutch becomes paranoid that a gang member is working as an informant. Several gang members become disenchanted and leave, while Dutch and Micah arrange one final heist of an Army payroll train.</p><p>Arthur's faith in Dutch is shattered when he abandons Arthur to the Army, leaves John for dead, and refuses to rescue Abigail when she is taken. Arthur and Sadie rescue Abigail from Milton, who names Micah as the Pinkertons' informer before Abigail kills him. Arthur returns to camp and openly accuses Micah of betrayal. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and Micah turn on Arthur and a newly returned John, but the standoff is broken when Pinkertons attack. The player can choose to have Arthur aid John's escape by delaying the Pinkertons or return to the camp to recover the gang's money. Micah ambushes Arthur, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.</p><p>Eight years later, in 1907, John and his family are trying to lead honest lives. They find work at a ranch where John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer. Believing John is unwilling to give up his old ways, Abigail leaves with Jack. John takes a loan from the bank to purchase a ranch. He works with Uncle, Sadie, and Charles to build a new home and proposes to Abigail on her return. Afterward, learning Micah is still alive and formed his own gang, John, Sadie, and Charles assault his camp and find a recently arrived Dutch, who shoots Micah after a tense standoff and leaves in silence, allowing John to kill him and claim the gang's Blackwater stash to pay his debt. John then marries Abigail, and they start a new life on their ranch alongside Jack and Uncle, as Sadie and Charles leave for other pursuits.</p><p>The final scene shows Edgar Ross observing John's ranch, foreshadowing the events of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p><h2>External Links</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Official website</a></p></li></ul>",

Gameplay involves battling various island factions as well as the occasional wildlife. As with the previous installment, missions can be accepted from various <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC</a>s throughout the world. <a href=\"/optional-objective/3015-3461/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3461\">Side missions</a> such as running deliveries and hunting can be completed for extra cash. Animals that can be encountered include tigers, bears, sharks, deer, and komodo dragons. The player also has multiple vehicles at their disposal, including jeeps, ATVs, jet skis, and hang gliders.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Various towns and outposts are scattered across the island. Attacking and securing enemy outposts allows the player to take control of them. In addition to acting as <a href=\"/fast-travel/3015-676/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-676\">fast travel</a> hubs, controlling outposts opens up missions in the surrounding area and gives the player access to <a href=\"/shopping/3015-1103/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1103\">shops</a>. Weapons and upgrades can be purchased here, and items discovered in the world such as <a href=\"/pelt/3055-3946/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3946\">animal skins</a> can be sold as well. Players are given a strong incentive to reset radio towers throughout the island in-order to unlock new weapons in the shops. Resetting radio towers also results in a more detailed mapping of that part of the island, similar to the \"syncing\" mechanic in the <a href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-38\">Assassin's Creed</a> series.</p><figure style=\"width: 816px\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378557\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.55147058823529\" data-width=\"816\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2378557\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg 816w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/60551/2378557-far_cry_3_the_heron_skill_tree.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Far Cry 3 rewards players with <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience</a> for completing missions and executing various kill moves, which then feeds into a <a href=\"/skill-tree/3015-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-382\">skill tree system</a>.

Jason narrowly escapes, and soon finds himself caught in the middle of a bloody power struggle for the island between the native Rakyat population and the occupying pirate forces.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jason quickly allies himself with the natives after being saved by Dennis Rogers, who introduces him to Citra (Vaas' sister). She informs him that while Vaas is certainly an enemy, the real threat is Hoyt Volker, a brutal human trafficker that is using the islands for his smuggling ring. He has corrupted Vaas with drugs and money, and has given him control of the entire northern island. Jason vows to kill Vaas and free his friends, and one by one he brings his friends to Doctor Earnhart, a man who agrees to help Jason and his friends. They find an old broken down boat nearby, and as Jason progresses through the story, they stay back and make repairs.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As time goes by, the Rakyat (and to certain extent Jason himself) start to believe that Jason is the reincarnation of the Rakyat's mythical warrior ancestor. Citra and her followers revere him, and implore him to stay and liberate their people. Jason agrees, and eventually hooks up with Willis Huntley, a CIA operative working on the island who helps him track down Vaas. Once Vaas is killed, Willis sends Jason off to the south island to connect with Sam Becker, another operative who is in deep undercover working directly with Hoyt. Sam helps Jason get close to Hoyt, and Jason is able to destroy Hoyt's smuggling ring and kill Hoyt in a knife fight, and save his brother Riley from captivity.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jason &amp; Riley go back to Earnhart and the boat, only to find everything on fire, his friends missing, and Earnhart mortally wounded. He tells Jason that Citra is responsible, and when Jason confronts Cirta at her temple, the player is <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">given a choice to end the game</a>; kill his friends and stay on the island forever, or free his friends and leave behind the Rakyat people.</p><h2><b>Characters</b></h2><h3>Jason Brody</h3><figure style=\"width: 1102px\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2334603\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.95099818511797\" data-width=\"1102\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2334603\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 1102w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 1102w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2334603-far_cry_3_far_cry_3_far_cry_jason_brody2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The protagonist of Far Cry 3, <a href=\"/jason-brody/3005-19174/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19174\">Jason Brody</a> is a 25-year-old from Los Angeles.

Far Cry 3 features competitive online multiplayer, as well as a <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-op campaign mode</a>, which supports up to four players. Certain in-game actions will result in player rewards, similar to the <a href=\"/kill-streak-reward/3015-4056/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4056\">kill-streak system</a> in the <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> series. A 'Battle Cry' can also be performed as a boost to nearby teammates.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A new feature introduced in multiplayer is Decoding. Players earn data sources such as hard drives, DVDs, and memory cards for completing matches in multiplayer and co-op. Once a data source has been acquired, the player can proceed to the Decoding tab to begin the process. Initially the player has access to one Decoder, but two more can be unlocked through leveling up and visiting the game's website. Once a Decoder is selected, a list of acquired data sources appears, and one can be selected. The Decoding process takes differing amounts of time depending on the probability of receiving a high ranking weapon mod or XP. Once the item is selected, the countdown begins, and continues even when the game is not on.</p><h3>Multiplayer Modes</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Domination</b> - A <a href=\"/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">conquest</a> type game mode where you capture and hold 3 different points on a map.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Team Deathmatch</b> - The standard one team vs the other, most kills win game mode.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Firestorm</b> - A mode that tasks players with setting fire to two of your opponents bases at the same time. after this, teams have to make it to a radar dish while battling the ever-spreading fire, which blocks routes and paths.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Transmission</b> - Each team attempts to obtain and control propaganda transmitters located all across the map. In order to win, your team must race to each transmitter as it is becoming active and hold it as long as possible.</p><h3>Co-op Campaign</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A completely separate plot from the main single player story, the <a href=\"/4-player-co-op/3015-2563/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2563\">4 player co-op</a> takes place 6 months before Jason Brody arrived on the island. Four people, Callum \"the Scottish Thug\", Leonard \"the Crooked Cop\", Mikhail \"the Russian Hitman\", and Tisha \"the Ex Soldier\" are left on a cruise ship that the captain sold to the Rook Island pirates. The four players battle their way out and follow the captain onto the island, intent on getting their revenge and stealing his money. There are 6 total missions in the co-op, with an additional 2 missions available exclusively to PlayStation 3 players in the High Tides DLC released in January 2013.</p><h3>Map Editor</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another feature carried over from the previous games is an in-game map editor, allowing players to create their own custom single player &amp; multiplayer maps. These can then be shared online with other players, and the development team will curate the best maps and cycle them into the online rotation for all players to use.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Brian Tyler composed Far Cry 3 soundtracks and it was released as a digital download on December 4, 2012.

Approximately 40% of the game occurs across the sea, as the other 60% remains on land - with \"50 unique locations\" including fisherman villages, jungles, temples, plantations, forts, complete islands, and Mayan ruins. Each of the areas have different gameplay focuses. For example, the Mayan ruins are based around puzzle solving and platforming, while the Coconut Islands are inhabited by enemies to fight.</p><p>The three largest cities, however, are Naussau (the pirate haven), Kingston (a lively, dangerous town), and Havana (the capital of Cuba). The team that worked on <a href=\"/far-cry-3/3030-32933/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32933\">Far Cry 3</a>'s open world design pitched in to add to the random elements and overall design of the Caribbean world. Added randomness includes storms and rain, which simple make things wet on land but add dangerous rogue waves and lack of visibility on sea.</p><p>In major ports and on minor islands, Kenway can collect treasure chests (some of which include plans for upgrades for his ship), animus fragments ( 200 glowing Macguffins of the past), sea chanties (songs for his crew to sing aboard the <em>Jackdaw), </em>and secret letters revealing the backstory of a mysterious character.</p><p>While sailing, randomly generated supplies and shipwrecked crewmen can be collected.</p><p><strong>Fighting on land</strong></p><p>With the addition of free aiming, Kenway can carry up to four guns and use them in one go. Cutlasses, swords, axes, rifles, and pistols are available. Using the d-pad, players select Kenway's primary weapons (swords, hands, or hidden blades) and his secondary weapons (pistols, smoke bombs, rope darts, sleeping darts, or berzerk darts) for use in battle. The same parry-into-combo system from previous games returns, with a successful parry and kill leading into the ability to chain kills quickly. In addition, quickly hitting the secondary button with pistols equipped will fire off a volley of up to four chained shots, potentially killing four enemies in a few seconds.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495911\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495911\"><img alt=\"Kenway executes an island guard\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kenway executes an island guard\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2840/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kenway executes an island guard</figcaption></figure><p>Kenway now regains health only over time when out of battle, leaving behind the health regenerating potions of previous games. This means that the player must decide whether to run or fight it out when low on health.</p><p>Assassination techniques of air, ground, double, and running assassinations make their return. Added here is the ability to tag enemies using Eagle Vision. If the player looks at enemies for a few seconds in this vision mode, a dot will appear over their heads and, upon returning to regular vision, that enemy will be highlighted. Highlighted enemies appear through walls, making awareness of their status and tracking them (especially during eavesdropping missions) far easier.</p><p><strong>Fighting on sea</strong></p><p>Kenway's greatest ally is his ship, The <em>Jackdaw. </em>Acquired during the story, the ship grows with the player's input. Salvaging supplies from warehouses or the open sea can give the player materials to upgrade the ship, but in order to truly improve her, the player must fight, incapacitate, and board other ships. Doing so will net the greatest amount of money, crew, ammunition, and upgrade materials in the form of cloth, wood, or metal. Using a spyglass reveals what each ship is carrying, its level (strength vs. the player's strength), and its type (gunboat, schooner, brig, frigate, or man o' war).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578670\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578670\"><img alt=\"During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28122/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well</figcaption></figure><p>Revising the system from Assassin's Creed III, AC IV places each type of ship-board weapon at a different location on the ship. When the player looks forward, they can fire the chain shot, which takes down enemy sails and makes them less maneuverable. Looking to either side brings up the aiming arc of the broadside cannons, the general damage weapon. Simply hitting the fire button from the side view will fire heavy shot, a flaming, short range attack that does massive damage. The back view will fire exploding barrels behind the player. Additionally, when acquired mortars can be fired at any time, with their button generating an aiming circle that can be moved side to side and forward and backward.</p><p>Successful destruction of an enemy ship results in explosions and burning sails, but it also gives the player the ability to board the ship. Choosing to board puts the player in control of Kenway with escalating requirements for success based on the power of the ship. While schooners simple require five dead crewmen, man o' wars require 20 dead, a destroyed flag, or killed officers or gunmen, or destroyed powder stores.</p><p>Upon successful boarding, the player can choose to repair their own ship by destroying this one, lower their sea-based wanted level by converting the ship, or send the ship to the second-screen and general mini-game Kenway's Fleet.</p><p>To take down forts that reveal sections of islands on the map and make areas less dangerous, the player must attack the stationary target while it fires cannon, heavy shot, and mortars at the <em>Jackdaw. </em></p><p><strong>Present Day Abstergo Entertainment</strong></p><p>The player takes on the role of an <a href=\"/abstergo-industries/3015-2653/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\">Abstergo Industries</a> employee in October 2013, rather than that of <a href=\"/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-305\">Desmond Miles</a>, who is dead.

This mode is played on smaller maps, where the compass and lookalikes are both turned off.</p><p><strong>Wanted</strong> - Much like Deathmatch except you are working within a full map, lookalikes are turned on and you have a compass to help you find your mark.</p><p><strong>Assassinate</strong> - In this mode, no contracts are given, instead players have to discern who other real players are based on their behavior, and assassinate them.</p><h3>Team Modes</h3><p><strong>Manhunt</strong> - This mode is split into two rounds. In one round one team are the hunters and the other team is the prey. In the second round, the roles are reversed.</p><p><strong>Artifact Assault</strong> - This mode is essentially Capture The Flag. Players are not allowed to assassinate while in enemy territory.</p><p><strong>Domination</strong> - This mode is a version of Conquest, where teams must capture and hold specific points on the map.</p><p><strong>Wolfpack</strong> - This co-op mode tasks players to work together to take down NPCs within a time limit. Synchronized assassinations aren’t necessary, but if players don’t time kills properly, other targets will flee, wasting precious time as you hunt them down to finish the job.</p><h3>Gamelab</h3><p>Gamelab gives the player the opportunity to build their own custom multiplayer modes by tweaking over 200 different parameters, such as scoring, ability sets, time limits, weapons, etc. The best community-made modes will grow as they gain followers, and Ubisoft will promote the most popular ones into the public playlist.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista SP2 or Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8 (both 32/64bit versions)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2Quad Q8400 @ 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon II X4 620 @ 2.6 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia Geforce GTX 260 or AMD Radeon HD 4870 (512MB VRAM with shader Model 4.0 or higher)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 30 GB available space</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible Sound Card with latest drivers</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Windows-Compatible keyboard and mouse required, controller optional.</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista SP2 or Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8 (both 32/64bit versions)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 2400S @ 2.5 GHz or better or AMD Phenom II x4 940 @ 3.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 470 or AMD Radeon HD 5850 (1024MB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0) or better</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 30 GB available space</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible Sound Card with latest drivers</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Supported video cards at the time of release: Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or better and GeForce GTX 400, GTX 500, GTX 600 and GTX 700 series.

        "deck": "A third-person open-world game from Ubisoft, set in an alternate version of Chicago where the entire city is connected under a single network, and a vigilante named Aiden Pearce uses it to fight back against a conspiracy.",
        "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Watch Dogs (styled Watch_Dogs in marketing) follows <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/aiden-pearce/3005-23427/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23427\">Aiden Pearce</a>, a hacker who can control the electrical grid and other systems in the city of <a href=\"/chicago/3035-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-293\">Chicago</a>. He possesses mobile hacking technology, which allows him to match people's real life identities with their online presences on the fly; he can also shut down mobile phone reception and listen in on phone calls.</p><p>Players can also take on the roles of other Watch Dogs and protect Aiden as he is chased by police. Multiple players exist in the city at one time, although when this multiplayer triggers or what other players would be doing when Aiden is not in trouble is unclear.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Aiden has multiple smart-phone abilities that affect the environment of the entire city. He can hack into almost any device nearby or via camera feed to do anything from gathering information, to skimming money from their bank account, to distracting or even killing enemies. He can stop trains, raise bridges and security barriers, overload nearby fuse boxes, or black out the entire city for a short period of time to allow him to sneak by or evade enemies. In some parts of the game, he can direct companions through stealth sequences, making use of his hacking abilities to help them through to the goal.</p><p>In combat, Aiden can wield a large variety of weapons including pistols, shotguns, submachineguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and even a grenade launcher. He can slow down time to shoot through his special Focus ability that recharges slowly on its own. He can instantly knock out single enemies in melee range with a telescoping police baton.</p><p>As the game progresses, Aiden can learn to craft ability items through parts he picks up or purchases from shops. Everything from remote-controlled IEDs, to communications-jamming devices, to Focus-boosting pills, to a ctOS scanner that can instantly ping all nearby enemies.</p><p>Aiden also carries a persistent reputation meter through the story. When he completes contracts and performs heroic actions, the public will side with him and not call for the police. If Aiden performs enough negative actions, like killing civilians or robbing stores, Aiden's picture will appear on the news and more Chicago citizens will call the police when they see him. Aiden can run up and grab the caller's phone or use his Jam Coms ability to cut off the call.</p><p>In the world itself, Aiden can take on side missions in the form of Fixer Contracts, conduct Investigations into the seedier parts of Chicago, or use his Profiler to find and stop criminal attacks just before they happen. For money, or just for fun, Aiden can compete in drinking games, poker games, slot machines, chess matches, and even a shell game.</p><p>Aiden can take control of a wide variety of vehicles to get around Chicago, including several different kinds of cars or trucks, motorcycles, and even boats, all through hacking them with ctOS. Aiden can hijack cars like the protagonist of a <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a> game, or call on Jordi to leave a \"pre-owned\" copy of a requested vehicle nearby.</p><h3>Online Contracts</h3><p>Another aspect of Watch_Dogs is the online hacking, where other players can drop into the game as enemy Fixers, and vice-versa. The player sees themselves as Aiden, while the opponent sees them as another randomly-generated character. There are multiple types of Online Contracts:</p><ul><li>ctOS Mobile Challenge: One player uses an iPhone or Android app to take control of a CPD helicopter and try to stop the other player, playing Aiden Pearce, from reaching a goal by calling in various police resources and hacking abilities to stop them. This is the only Online Contract that requires both players to permit the other to invade.</li><li>Online Free Roam: Up to 8 players can join a single session and do whatever they please in Chicago.</li><li>Online Decryption: 4-8 players are split into 2 teams of Fixers. One team must grab the file and hold it to decrypt it while the enemy team must kill the file-holder to finish decrypting it themselves. More teammates near the file-holder helps to decrypt the file faster.</li><li>Online Race: 3-8 players compete in a race around Chicago in one of several varieties of vehicles, including boats and motorcycles.</li><li>Online Hacking: An invading Fixer has five minutes to locate their enemy and start installing a backdoor virus into their phone. The invaded player must then use their Profiler to find the enemy withing a shrinking area before they finish hacking and kill them. If the invader tries to kill the enemy before the download is complete, they automatically lose.</li><li>Online Tailing: Similar to Online Hacking, the invading Fixer must tail the enemy within a certain radius of them without being spotted until their meter reaches 100%. Unlike Online Hacking, the player is not restricted to a small area of the map. The invaded fixer must identify their attacker and then kill them. If the invader is discovered, they can kill their quarry or escape for partial success.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p>In 2013, a \"Fixer\" named Aiden Pierce lives and works in Chicago, using his great hacking skills to skim money and information from anyone he needs through a system called \"ctOS\" (Centralized Operating System) that has connected the entire city in one gigantic network. However, after stumbling on some important data he wasn't supposed to find, Aiden's niece is killed in a hit-and-run that was meant for him.</p><p>Aiden's quest for revenge on both the killer and the people who hired him takes him across Chicago, putting him at odds with an old-school mob boss, an Iraq war veteran, a hacktivist from \"DedSec,\" and a disgruntled former employee of the Blume Corporation who originally designed ctOS.</p><h2>Bad Blood</h2><p>About one year after the events of the main Watch Dogs story, Aiden and T-Bone both plan to flee from Chicago and the eyes of ctOS. However, T-Bone receives a panicked call from Tobias Frewer, former Blume colleague and co-creator of ctOS who has become homeless and mentally unstable, as he's kidnapped by Fixers working for Blume. T-Bone reluctantly finds himself staying in Chicago to help Tobias and tie up a few loose ends before he can leave Chicago for good.</p><p>Similar to Aiden, T-Bone can hack connected devices, and acquire and equip the same weapons as Aiden. T-Bone also has a special RC car that can be used to scout ahead, knock out enemies, and extend his hacking range. T-Bone also can carry out \"Street Sweeper\" missions, similar to Aiden's Fixer Contracts, that can be used to gain money, experience points, and other special perks. Some of these missions can be played in co-op mode with another player online, or repeated to get a higher score on the Leaderboards.</p><h2>E3 Demonstrations</h2><p>When the game was announced at the Ubisoft E3 2012 conference, a lengthy gameplay demonstration was shown. In this demonstration, the protagonist is shown controlling the electricity grid, which allows him to manipulate street lights. This power was used to create a pile-up to entrap a digital artist named Joseph Demarco. Another section of the demo shows him trying to gain access to a building. In order to distract the guard at the door he shuts down communications in that area of the city at which point calls are cut off for NPC's. This causes enough confusion that the guard effectively abandons his post and allows the player into the building.</p><p>At Sony's Playstation Meeting where they revealed the PS4, Ubisoft played through a brief open-world section of the game. \"There is no mission,\" they said, as Aiden walked the streets of Chicago. Most NPCs he encountered had dossiers projected for Aiden to see, revealing a homeless man to be an Iraq War veteran and a suited man to be a Tobacco Executive and Pro Life activist. Using a radial menu Aiden hacks the suited man's bank account and takes out of a nearby ATM.</p><p>Aiden cannot control everything. A security camera run by another entity was marked in red and secure. He can, however, using background histories and probabilities, detect the likelihood of events. Because a woman who had recently won a child custody battle was walking near an alley where her former husband was waiting, a crime probability bar began filling up as she walked toward the ambush. Aiden had the choice to help her and he did, interceding when the man put her at knife point. There is then an optional chase sequence where cops are alerted due to gun fire. In an alley, Aiden takes control of an electrical panel, overheats it, and takes down the man. To escape the cops, he stops an El-Line train and hops aboard.</p><p>As well as Aiden's ability to use technology to hack into systems and manipulate electrical devices, he can also employ many other skills to accomplish his goals. These include sneaking around environments and hiding behind cover, parkour-like actions to quickly traverse the city, and the ability to slow down time.</p><p>At the Sony Press Conference at E3 2013, another gameplay demo showed Pierce navigating an alerted city in order to save his colleague T-Bone from discovery. Pierce drove his car stealthily through the city streets, using the mini-map and environmental awareness to avoid patrolling police vehicles. When spotted by a helicopter search light, however, he drove to a hidden parking garage on Chicago's Lower Wacker Drive, losing the cops and taking the back entrance into a humming coffee shop. However, due to his raised alert status, the TV in the shop projected his image and Pierce had to smash the cell phone of a patron calling 911. This sequence demonstrated the real-world impact of a raised alert, where even after breaking line of sight the player must be cautious as any TV could begin the chase anew.</p><p>Pierce reaches his destination of a nondescript building where he hacks into the security cameras, then into a laptop camera to locate T-Bone, who has found a piece of computer hardware that impresses him. Pierce appears to need line of sight in order to hack and affect the world, but he can gain it through any camera in the world. In this case, he sees a screen array that he can turn on to distract the guard and give T-Bone an exit. Pierce then takes on a squad-command role as he directs T-Bone across a courtyard patrolled by guards, with T-Bone following the player's commands. Pierce can turn the lights on the parked cars on to distract guards as well.</p><p>However, they are discovered as they escape and Pierce kills a private security man before being sighted by a police helicopter.</p><p>The \"second-screen\" functionality was then revealed further as Pierce called for a random mobile user's help. This user, on a tablet, is playing at the CtOS system itself. The user shuts down the helicopter's systems for a second, momentarily disabling it but not destroying it, giving Pierce the time to get away.</p><p>He runs into some cops, though, and must employ more gadgetry. On his smart-phone select screen of abilities, he chooses total blackout, which kills every light in the city.
